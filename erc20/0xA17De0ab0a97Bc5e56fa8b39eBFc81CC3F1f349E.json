{"symbol": "DFK","address": "0xA17De0ab0a97Bc5e56fa8b39eBFc81CC3F1f349E","overview":{"en": "Defiking is described to be a decentralized cross chain platform that realizes smart contract by cross-chain protocol and improves decentralization and data security by oracle mechanism. DFK, the token of DeFiKing, has been launched on Uniswap and JustSwap, supporting ERC20 and TRC20 respectively. There are 1 billion tokens available on each chain, of which, 1% is in circulation, 10% is held by DFK team and DFK foundation, and the rest 89% will be issued for the incoming DFK mining. Depending on the community development on these two chains, and to maintain the 1 billion total issuances, DFK foundation will decide the final retention ratio based on the situation in the communities(i.e. the total circulation of Uniswap and JustSwap should be kept at 10 million tokens), burn and withdraw the rest of the tokens."},"email": "","website": "https://www.defiking.io/","state": "NORMAL","links": {"blog": "https://medium.com/@dfkblockchain","twitter": "https://twitter.com/dfkblockchain","telegram": "","github": ""}}
